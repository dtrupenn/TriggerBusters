/**
 * The object registry manages a collection of global singleton objects.  However, it differs from
 * the standard singleton pattern in a few important ways:
 * - The objects managed by the registry have an undefined lifetime.  They may become invalid at 
 *   any time, and they may not be valid at the beginning of the program.
 * - The only object that is always guaranteed to be valid is the ObjectRegistry itself.
 * - There may be more than one ObjectRegistry, and there may be more than one instance of any of
 *   the systems managed by ObjectRegistry allocated at once.  For example, separate threads may
 *   maintain their own separate ObjectRegistry instances.
