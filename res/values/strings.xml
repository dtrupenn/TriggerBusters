    <string name="DisplayRules">The city is filled with dust and it\'s your job to clean it all up!
Use the arrow keys to move around the city and pick up the dust pieces along the way.
Watch out for the asthma triggers though. The pet, mold, cockroach, and cigarette will chase you all around the board.
You start with two inhalers and one nebulizer. Every time you get hit by a trigger, you need to take a puff.
After two inhaler puffs, if you get hit, it\'s time to use the nebulizer.
One more hit after you use your nebulizer means a game over so be careful!
See if you can beat your high score!
Good luck!!!</string>
